# Pizza Ordering App
This project is about writing a pizza ordering code, which enables the customer to buy a pizza. The system provides 4 sizes (S, M, L, XL) and their price is 40, 50, 60, and 75 respectively.
For each pizza, the customer can order extras. Each extra will cost 2$. The system also intended to make a delivery so if the destination is in "Beer Sheva" will cost 20$. If the distention, it's outside of the "Negev Capital City" the customer will pay 60$.

Note! This system provides service only for those who are above 18
